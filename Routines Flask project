This is my Gym Routines Flask project.
It allows users to add personalized workout routines by entering the name of the workout, selecting its difficulty level, writing a description of how it is done, and uploading an image of the workout.
Users can view all their added routines in a clean layout and also have the option to remove a workout if needed.
The app is simple, user-friendly, and runs locally through Flask.

Below is my git hub repository

In the images folder i have also put in the image with my AWS web screenshot.
